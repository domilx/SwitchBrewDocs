Switch Terminology
==================

RCM
---
RCM stands for ReCovery Mode.

........

OFW
---
OFW stands for Original Firmware. It is your devices unmodified firmware.

........

Homebrew
--------
A term used to describe unofficial software created by developers for a locked down system. When it comes to the Switch, such software can include save managers, emulators, or games.

........

CFW
---
CFW Stands for Custom Firmware. It is a firmware that modifies the system firmware to allow it to run homebrew.

........

NAND
----
The NAND is your devices built in memory (not to be confused with the SD card). The Nintendo Switch has the memory size of 32GB and by default has 25.9GB of free storage, and the rest is taken up by the operating system.

........

SysNAND
-------
SysNAND stands for "System NAND". The SysNAND is the contents stored on your devices built in memory (not to be confused with OFW). It contains everything ranging from the operating system itself, to games, screenshots, videos, and save files. Every device, hacked or unhacked, has a SysNAND. 

........

EmuNAND
-------
EmuNAND stands for "Emulated NAND".
The EmuNAND is a copy of your SysNAND that resides on your SD card and not on your devices internal memory. Think of it as having a secondary Nintendo Switch on your SD card. It is used to isolate any actions that you might perform from your SysNAND that could either harm your device or performing any other actions that might get you banned. Any changes or actions that you perform in your EmuNAND won't affect your SysNAND since it is just a copy. 

........

Signature Patches
-----------------
Signature patches or SigPatches allow your device to bypass signature checks performed by horizon for installed titles. 

........

Hekate
------
A custom bootloader that allows you to bypass fuse checks and has a lot of useful tools. It is used to boot into CFW and to create and restore NAND backups.

........

Nintendo Submission Package or NSP is either a dump of an installed title or a homebrew package that can be installed.

........

XCI
---
XCI is a cartridge dump of a Nintendo Switch game. It can be played on a hacked Nintendo Switch using a CFW.

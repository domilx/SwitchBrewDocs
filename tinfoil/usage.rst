================

Tinfoil is a powerful homebrew application for the Nintendo Switch that allows users to manage, install, and customize games, updates, and other content on hacked consoles. With its user-friendly interface, users can easily navigate through different sections such as Titles, Shops, Files, and Settings. Tinfoil provides the ability to browse and install games from Tinfoil shops, manage installed titles, and customize the console's appearance. However, it's important to use Tinfoil responsibly, respecting copyright and licensing agreements, and being cautious when downloading content from untrusted sources. By leveraging the capabilities of Tinfoil, Nintendo Switch users can enhance their gaming experience and explore a wide range of unofficial content.

The tinfoil UI has a lot of hidden sections so we will go over them now

To add a Shop go to file browser and click the - button. From there simply follow the respective prompts for the shop you want to add.
